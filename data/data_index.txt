- Observations for each Case Study are formatted as a column vector labeled as "x".
- Probabilistic forecasts for Case Study 1+2 are formatted as MxN matrices, where M (rows) is the ensemble size, and N (columns) is the number of time points.
  Each column is named "t=a+h(t0=a)". Where t0=a is the time point for the most recent observation, and h is the forecast horizon. For example, t=17(t0=15) refers
  to the forecast of X at time 17 given observations up to and including time 15.
- Point forecasts for Case Study 3 is formatted as a column vector labeled as "x" (like the observation data).
